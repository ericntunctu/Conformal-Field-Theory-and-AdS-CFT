Mathematica codes for Conformal Field Theory and AdS/CFT
This repository contains several aspect of calculation in AdS/CFT(Witten Diagrams etc) and CFT(differential operators act on scalar conformal blocks). <br> <br>
1:Mack Polynomial: mack polynomial is a important polynomial in conformal field theory.
One can see derivation in https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5625. Mack Polynomial.nb defines mack polynomial in Mathematica. One can check for lower spin and compare it to the paper. One can also see:https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07991 ; https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00572
